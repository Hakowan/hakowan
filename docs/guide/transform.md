# Transform

Transform is applied to the entire data frame as a pre-processing step. It is useful to modify the
geometry and/or computing new attributes from existing attributes.

## Filter transform

Filter transform extracts a subset of the 3D elements based on a user provided condition.

```py
tr = hkw.transform.Filter(data="attr_name", condition=lambda value: value > 0)
```

## Combining multiple transforms
